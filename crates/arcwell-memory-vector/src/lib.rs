//! Vector store backends for the Arcwell Memory.
//!
//! The default `embedded` backend is an in-process, optionally file-persisted
//! store with native BM25 keyword search — it requires no external services and
//! underpins the single-binary deployment. The `qdrant` and `pgvector` backends
//! are feature-gated for users who want external scale.
